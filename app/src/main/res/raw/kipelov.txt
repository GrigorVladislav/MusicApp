In 2002, dissension in the heavy metal band Aria led to Aria members Valery Kipelov (vocals), Sergey Terentyev (guitar), and Alexander Maniakin (drums) leaving the band and joining with former Aria member Sergey Mavrin and bassist Alexey Harkov of Mavrik to form Kipelov. The band was named to make use of the fame of its best-known member, singer Valery Kipelov. Since Kipelov was, essentially, just a revision of Aria, they were able to begin performing immediately.

In the fall of 2002 Kipelov toured over Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, including a sold-out concert in Moscow at the end of November at the legendary Gorbunov Palace of Culture.

In May 2003, after a brief hiatus from touring, the group performed a concert in the open-air Voel Amphitheatre in Tel Aviv, Israel. On May 24, 2003, as part of a cultural program dedicated to the 300th anniversary of Saint Petersburg, the band performed a concert in Saint Petersburg Stadium. Video and audio versions of this concert were released.
